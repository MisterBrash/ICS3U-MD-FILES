# 1.1 - Output & the Console

Now that you've done the [Hello World! program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), you know that we can print to the developer console with:

[**JavaScript**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/):
```JS
console.log("some text");
```
[**Python**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/):
```Python
print("some text")
```
**Java**:
```Java
System.out.println("some text");
```
**C++**:
```C++
std::cout << "some text\n";
```

## Special Characters & Escape Sequences
Most programming languages use some special commands for things like a new line or tab (indent). These are called **escape sequences** and we use a backslash `\` to "escape" them.

|Sequence|Usage|
|---|---|
|\n|Most common - used for a **new line**.|
|\r|Used for a carriage return (not used often)|
|\t|Used to insert a _horizontal_ **tab** (indent)|
|\v|Used to insert a _vertical_ tab|
|\\"|Used to insert a single double-quote character|
|\\'|Used to insert a single single-quote character|
|\\\\|Used to insert a blackslash character|

## Console.log( )
Remember that you need to use quotes if you want to print text. 
```JS
console.log("This is \"text\"");
// Output:  This is "text"
```
One last thing - every time you use the `console.log( )` command, it automatically adds a new line at the end.


## Your Tasks:

#### 1. Add the appropriate code(s) to the JavaScript file [index.js](#index.js) that will print the address for Apple Inc.:
>Apple Inc.<br>One Apple Park Way<br>Cupertino, CA<br>95014<br>+1 408-996-1010

#### 2. Output two blank lines (to separate task 1 and 3)

#### 3. Now print the following with only a SINGLE `console.log( )` command:
>Microsoft Corporation<br>One Microsoft Way<br>Redmond, WA<br>98052<br>+1 425-882-8080

#### 4. Output two blank lines (to separate task 3 and 5)

#### 5. Finally, output the following to the console using _one_ `console.log( )` command and horizontal tabs between the letters:
```
x  o  x
o  x  o
x  o  x
```

Submit when complete.

If you finish with class time left, you can complete the ISU or take a look at [go.brash.ca/karel](https://go.brash.ca/karel)
